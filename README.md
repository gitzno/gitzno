### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name HoÃ ng Thá»¥y
I am currently a senior student at FPT University, majoring in Software Engineering. Born in a land of bold cultural identities and grown up in the technological development era, I have realized that my greatest goal is to create human-centered products that can be applied technological quintessence and solve their contemporary problems. In the near future, with the knowledge of system structure, together with visual knowledge of building interfaces, I want to complete more skills and become a full-stack developer.
